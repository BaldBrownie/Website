            8/21-8/24 Week 1 <br> This week is the first week and we worked on our chromebook. We scowered through different websites learning about each one of them and getting to use them. We first had to sign up for an AWS account in order to get to where I am typing right now. We also signed up to github in order to access a token. On Aug 24 we did our first challenge which was 2 teams and we were trying to get a marble into the bucket only using pvc pipes, we didn't complete the challenge but we were close. Finally, this week we finished up class with out website.
