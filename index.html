            8/21-8/24 Week 1
            <br> This week is the first week and we worked on our chromebook.
            We scowered through different websites learning about each one of them and getting to use them.
            We first had to sign up for an AWS account in order to get to where I am typing right now. We also signed up to github in order to access a token.
            On Aug 24 we did our first challenge which was 2 teams and we were trying to get a marble into the bucket only using pvc pipes, we didn't complete the challenge but we were close.
            Finally, this week we finished up class with out website.

           8/28-8/31 Week 2
            
           <br> This is our second week. We first learned about mechanical engineering and the design process on Monday.
           Then we went over the Rube Goldberg project that required us to pop a balloon using a set amount of materials.
           We drew our designs for the project and then shared our designs with our teams.
           We also learned about TinkerCad and how to use the system to make a design.
           We finished the week off with a TinkerCad challenge which was making a home appliance.

            9/5-9/7 Week 3
            
            <br> Third week of the semester we worked on our Rube Goldberg machines.
            We needed to have the same design on tinkercad and in our real life design.
            We did not make major changes to our online design instead we just added new items or finished what we didn't finish.
            This week we also took our quiz on mechanical engineering so we studied a bit then we took our quiz.
            The final thing we did this week was building our machine, we first built the walls and then we added our ramp.

                9/11-9/14 Week 4
                <br>This week was our fourth week in this class.
                We only worked on building on Rube Goldberg Machine.
                Our project needed 3 tools which were a pulley, a car, and a ramp.
                We first taped the pulley rope to the table.
                Then we dropped the baseball into the car which released the tape holding the car.
                Finally the ramp gave the car enough momentum to pop the balloon.

                9/18-9/21 Week 5
                <br>This week we didn't do much, however we did do to challenges.
                Our first challenge was to build a paper boat that could float on the water with weight for 5 minutes.
                My boat lasted the full 5 minutes and it held 59 grams of weight.
                The second challenge that we had to do was create an E and give specific directions for another person to draw it.
                So I drew my E then everyones E's got shuffled and I was handed another person E to follow and cut out. Some issues for the E were not accurate sides
                The final thing we did this week was do a worksheet on Computer Engineering which we are probably going to be starting soon.
