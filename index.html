            8/21-8/24 Week 1
            <br> This week is the first week and we worked on our chromebook.
            We scowered through different websites learning about each one of them and getting to use them.
            We first had to sign up for an AWS account in order to get to where I am typing right now. We also signed up to github in order to access a token.
            On Aug 24 we did our first challenge which was 2 teams and we were trying to get a marble into the bucket only using pvc pipes, we didn't complete the challenge but we were close.
            Finally, this week we finished up class with out website.

           8/28-8/31 Week 2
            
           <br> This is our second week. We first learned about mechanical engineering and the design process on Monday.
           Then we went over the Rube Goldberg project that required us to pop a balloon using a set amount of materials.
           We drew our designs for the project and then shared our designs with our teams.
           We also learned about TinkerCad and how to use the system to make a design.
           We finished the week off with a TinkerCad challenge which was making a home appliance.

            9/5-9/7 Week 3
            
            <br> Third week of the semester we worked on our Rube Goldberg machines.
            We needed to have the same design on tinkercad and in our real life design.
            We did not make major changes to our online design instead we just added new items or finished what we didn't finish.
            This week we also took our quiz on mechanical engineering so we studied a bit then we took our quiz.
            The final thing we did this week was building our machine, we first built the walls and then we added our ramp.
