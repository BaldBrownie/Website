            8/21-8/24 Week 1
            <br> This week is the first week and we worked on our chromebook.
            We scowered through different websites learning about each one of them and getting to use them.
            We first had to sign up for an AWS account in order to get to where I am typing right now. We also signed up to github in order to access a token.
            On Aug 24 we did our first challenge which was 2 teams and we were trying to get a marble into the bucket only using pvc pipes, we didn't complete the challenge but we were close.
            Finally, this week we finished up class with out website.

           8/28-8/31 Week 2
            
           <br> This is our second week. We first learned about mechanical engineering and the design process on Monday.
           Then we went over the Rube Goldberg project that required us to pop a balloon using a set amount of materials.
           We drew our designs for the project and then shared our designs with our teams.
           We also learned about TinkerCad and how to use the system to make a design.
           We finished the week off with a TinkerCad challenge which was making a home appliance.

            9/5-9/7 Week 3
            
            <br> Third week of the semester we worked on our Rube Goldberg machines.
            We needed to have the same design on tinkercad and in our real life design.
            We did not make major changes to our online design instead we just added new items or finished what we didn't finish.
            This week we also took our quiz on mechanical engineering so we studied a bit then we took our quiz.
            The final thing we did this week was building our machine, we first built the walls and then we added our ramp.

                9/11-9/14 Week 4
                <br>This week was our fourth week in this class.
                We only worked on building on Rube Goldberg Machine.
                Our project needed 3 tools which were a pulley, a car, and a ramp.
                We first taped the pulley rope to the table.
                Then we dropped the baseball into the car which released the tape holding the car.
                Finally the ramp gave the car enough momentum to pop the balloon.

                9/18-9/21 Week 5
                <br>This week we didn't do much, however we did do to challenges.
                Our first challenge was to build a paper boat that could float on the water with weight for 5 minutes.
                My boat lasted the full 5 minutes and it held 59 grams of weight.
                The second challenge that we had to do was create an E and give specific directions for another person to draw it.
                So I drew my E then everyones E's got shuffled and I was handed another person E to follow and cut out. Some issues for the E were not accurate sides
                The final thing we did this week was do a worksheet on Computer Engineering which we are probably going to be starting soon.

                9/25-9/28 Week 6
                <br>This week we learned how to take apart a computer.
                We first had to disasemble each part correctly and then the computer was completely disasemble.
                Then we had to put all the pieces back into the right place.
                If it was not correctly put back together then the computer would not work.
                The final thing we did was take a quiz on computer engineering.

                10/2-10/6 Week 7
                <br> On Monday I was sick so I do not know what our class did on Monday.
                However, I came back to school on Tuesday.
                We worked on making a cardboard prothetic hand that could pick up a plastic watter bottle.
                Our hand used 5 fingers that wrapped around the bottle to pick it up.
                On Thursday we first worked on filling out a worksheet about Biomechanics.
                Then we had to make a tinkercad desgin that was a prosthetic limb for an animal.
                The final thing we did was work on our website.
                <br><img src=https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=9609c23e0d&attid=0.1&permmsgid=msg-a:r2864482119035580330&th=18b1639d3d3c85c7&view=fimg&fur=ip&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ9r-kJc9PBASgINswdj-5H9dB6XrLdK8PyfgrQV8xZK_nZ5FhmqIElMzH4gBwPiTJGDOooU-GQkn2azAqQz2C2IvM5xQBa8GJg4js_Pc9OSWzk1PhlzmOEm0u8&disp=emb&realattid=18b16388035f281b2231 width="180px" height="120px">

        10/8-10/12 Week 8
        <br> This week was a 4 day week for freshman due to the psat.
        However we still did quite a bit this week.
        First we switched seats so I am sitting with new people.
        Next we took a quiz on biomechanics, it took a while.
        Then we went over the Aerospace engineering slides and watched a video on space x self landing rocket.
        Finally, we worked on a tinkercad model of our rocket that we are going to make next week.

                10/16-10/19 Week 9
                <br> This week we worked ona bottle rocket. We made our Tinkercad design on Monday to have a good idea of what our rocket was going to be like.
                We only built on Tuesday and we had the whole period to work on it. We used cardboard, a 2 liter bottle,some hot glue, and tape.
                We launched our rocket but it was a big fail. Our rocket got stuck in the launch and didn't go very far
                If I were to change our design I would make it a missle instead of a plane with wings.
                I thought a place with wings would glide to make it farther but the weight distribution made it twist and fall
                A missle design would have made it quicker but not glide but it would have made it farther.

                10/23-10/25 Week 10
                <br>This week we learned about Enviromental Engineering.
                We did a worksheet about Enviromental Engineering and looked on slides.
                We looked at pollution and water treatment.
                The next class we worked project that had to make a filter only using rocks,pebbles,sand, and cotton
                The water that was given was black water and we had to treat it as best as possible.
                My partner and I got our water to a yellow, but it was still clearly contaminated.
                One group got the water to a clear color.

                10/30-11/3 Week 11
                <br> This week we learned about electrical engineering.
                We talked about ohms law which is V(Volts)=I(Amps)*R(resistance).
                We learned about bread boards resistors and LEDs and how to make a ciruit using them.
                There are two types of circuits a parallel and series.
                A parallel the LEDs are not connected and each of them have their own resistor and connect to ground seperatly.
                Series the LEDs are connected and each of them have 1 resistor and 1 ground.

                This week we learned worked on real life breadboards.
                We were given a pieces like LED, wires, and resistor.
                Lab 1 was just making a standard circuit with 1 LED on.
                Lab 2 was making a series circuit where LEDS are next to each other and a parallel circuit where the LEDS are parallel to eaach other.
                Lab 3 the same circuits as the previous labs but we had to use a multimeter to find the volatage and the resistance.
                Lab 4 was using an arduino making certain circuits to make the LEDs light up or light off.

                We learned about Business engineering this week.
                We looked at slides and talked about what Business engineers need to do.
                When you sell a product you try to get the customer to buy it again or comeback.
                SO you take feedback from customers to improve the design or item.
                Our project for this lesson is to make a Shark Tank pitch with an item.
                My partner wants to do a cheating pencil that you can use on tests but I think it is a terrible idea.

                11/27-11/30 Week 14
                This week we worked on our Shark Tank pitch.
                Our idea was making a wireless measuring tape where two pins measure the distance and it goes to a screen.
                Our team looked up to see if the idea was on the market and it was not.
                One question we got was how we could regulate the distance because the pins might move.
                Our solution is to put the reader on the base so it is more accurate.
                My favorite pitch was the childless air because it is a nice flight without children screaming.

                Finals Week 15
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Our bridge weighed about 52 grams.</li>
          <li>Our bridge held about 3800 grams. It was the second most weight our of all the bridges</li>
          <li>Our bridge ratio was 73. This was the best ratio in our class.</li>
          <li>The heaviest part of our bridge was the connectors. Our bridge was 4 segements that we glued together. So we added some extra straws to reinforce the structure.</li>
          <li>The inspiration of our bridges come frm the small bridges that used a little arch to support itself. Since the distance between the two sides was not very far it was. </li>
          <li>Our design worked better than we expected. Our expectations were for the bridge to be in the middle of the pack for our class. Instead we got the best ratio in the class.</li>
          <li>The point where our bridge broke was in the middle. That is where we expected the bridge to breakd because we didn't add many major supports to the middle and the pressure was also put on the middle.</li>
          <li>If we had more spaghtii straws to use I would probably use it to add more support to the middle so it won't break.</li>

                This was our first week back from Winter break and it is the start of semester 2.
                On Monday our internet was down and we still could not do anything.
                We just played the name game which was writing an intresting fact about yourself and you get a random card from someone else and you find the person.
                On Tuesday we just caught up with work from semester 1 because we finally got our internet back so we needed to turn any work that was due online while the internet was down.
                On Thursday we made ooblek which is a slime like substance made from cornstartch and water.
                When you apply pressure the substance feels hard but if you sit then the substances becomes a liquid and sinks.

                1/16-1/18 S2 Week 2
                This week we had Monday off because of MLK. We are working on a new project which is a mousetrap car.
                We are split up into partners and we need to make a project proposal.
                The project proposal is a bunch of details and info that we research and what is going to best for our car.
                We watched some videos and looked at websites and some of the stuff we found were.
                Large back wheels because it increases rotational inertia and a small axle because it would rotate more while traveling less.
                You want a long lever as well for your car to power it.

                This week we worked on our Mousetrap car and took a chemical engineering quiz.
                On monday we just worked on websites and took the chemical engineering quiz.
                The rest of the week we worked on our mousetrap car.
                We took notes on how to calculate distance and we drew out our dimensions.
                After we took the models into tinkercad to make a rough idea of what our car is trying to look like.
                This is only our first draft so our team will make changes according to our first test.

                1/29-2/2 S2 Week 4
        This week we worked on building our Mousetrap car. We our measuring with centimeters instead of inches.
        The body is made of cardboard but it isn't very stable because it is folding into intself.
        Our wheels and axles rotate inside a wheel but our wheels are not very stable and are collapsng.
        When we tested our car first it spun the back wheels but it never moved because the body made contact with the ground.
        Our plan is to just fix up all of our issues that cause our car to not move.

                2/5-2/9 S2 Week 5 and 6
        <ol type="1">
         <li>In this week we finished our first mousetrap car design. We had to remodel our car a bit because it could not move because of a bending body. We strengthend the body and wheels. One flaw in our design was the mousetrap not fully loading because the dowel wasn't properly attached, so we lost a bit of power.</li>
        <li>Our car overall went relativley straight it only slightly curved but it was good.On our second design we need to strengthen the attachment from dowel to mousetrap and also make sure to not get the string stuck when tying. In the end we just went back to our first desing due to our second car not spinning as fast we decided to just reglue the dowel and it went 75 feet</li>
        <li>Our first test went 64 feet but it was supposed to go 70 feet. Our percent error is 8.57% negatively for our first test.</li>
        <li>Our next steps are to start building our second car because we have analyzed and tested our first car and my group understands what went wrong. We just fixed the issues on our first car.</li>
        <li>My group started building our second car however it is worse than our first one which is sad.
        It is worse by quite a bit as well because our first test went 64 feet and our second test went 41 feet. Our final test went 75 feet and what we did was build a whole second car but it didn't work and just fixed the first car to make it go farther.</li>

                2/20-2/23 Week 7
        This week we tested our finished cars and our car went really far. The car went about 75 feet which was farther than our intial calculations were.
        Even after some tweaks I didn't expect our car to increase by 10 feet.
        If I were to imrpove my car I would glue the dowel to the car better to not lose power. I would also move my string attacment as my car sometimes got stuck to go straws because I didnt place it properly.

        2/26-2/29 Week 8
        Our research involved using a cushion to prevent the egg from breaking. You mainly want all the pressure to not go towards the egg and instead toward something else.
        Our design is going to work because we have a parachute and cotton ball as a cushion for our egg.
        We have built most of the body however it is not working how I itended.
        We also did a door and wheels challenge and I was apart of team wheels.
        A wheel is an object that spins around an axle so wwe calculated about 20,000 wheels because there are 200 classrooms and each classroom has about 100 wheels.
        This also doesn't include the other wheels like cars and door hinges.

         3/4-3/7 Week 9
         This week we worked on building our egg drop challenge. I was not present on Tuesday so my partner just added straws to the sides to reduce force on impact.
         On thursday we did a challenge. We did a challenge that was with 1 piece of paper get the papaer to travel the farthest.
         I decided to make a plane because I thought it would go far but it went into the tree.
         The farthest paper was just a thrown ball.

        <li>We tested our EggDrop this week. Our design was successful. All of our componenets helped in making the egg not break, parachute, cotton box, and straws.</li>

        <li>We also worked on a 100m balloon challenge. Our design did not work and the balloon fell and broke. I think this is due to the sticks not being tight enough making the ballon slip and fall. We need to make a tighter seal for next time.</li>

         3/26-3/29 Week 11
         Our newest project is a gutter boat challenge. It needs to travel 500 centimeters in the shortest time possible.
        Our boat is a body of a plastic cup and we have a propellor with te rubber band that stores energy.
        We think our boat will win because the propellor moves very quickly.
        Some of the restrictions for our boat was the amount of materials we were able to use.
        Our orginal plane was to use more popsicle sticks but we could only use 4 so instead we decided to use a paper cup for our body.
        Our cup is also bending right now so we need to add something so it doesn't bend.

         4/1-4/5 Week 12
         This week both my partner and I had to leave early on Tuesday while we worked on our gutter boat.
         Originally our boat was made out of a plastic cup but then the desing broke so we had to restart.
         We decided to make a boat out of sticks with a propeller but when we tested it, the project failed.
         Our project just flipped because there was too much energy being sent through and not enough weight to hold the boat from flipping.
         If I were to remake our boat I would make a sailboat.

         4/8-4/12 Week 13
         This week we worked on a tinkercad to build a cardboard boat that 2 people sit in.
         The goal was to make it the other side and back. The boat I designed was just a box with a pointy front to cut through the water.
         Then I added 2 oars to paddle our way across. Then we did a challenge.
         The goal was to make the longest bridge as possible with 15 post it notes.
         Our team cut up into 1/4 inch pieces and we got to 361 inches.

         4/15-4/19 Week 14
         This week we worked on building our boat. The classroom doesnot have enough cardboard so many teams have to halt their projects.
         Our group has gotten the base but we have not started on our walls. We follow a sketch that our team drew not the tinkercad.
         The tinkercad is not a scaled model it is just a design. Our team needs more cardboard to build the rest of the boat.
         We want to make 16 inch tall walls with a slant at the top.
