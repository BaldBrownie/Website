            8/21-8/24 Week 1
            <br> This week is the first week and we worked on our chromebook.
            We scowered through different websites learning about each one of them and getting to use them.
            We first had to sign up for an AWS account in order to get to where I am typing right now. We also signed up to github in order to access a token.
            On Aug 24 we did our first challenge which was 2 teams and we were trying to get a marble into the bucket only using pvc pipes, we didn't complete the challenge but we were close.
            Finally, this week we finished up class with out website.

           8/28-8/31 Week 2
            
           <br> This is our second week. We first learned about mechanical engineering and the design process on Monday.
           Then we went over the Rube Goldberg project that required us to pop a balloon using a set amount of materials.
           We drew our designs for the project and then shared our designs with our teams.
           We also learned about TinkerCad and how to use the system to make a design.
           We finished the week off with a TinkerCad challenge which was making a home appliance.

            9/5-9/7 Week 3
            
            <br> Third week of the semester we worked on our Rube Goldberg machines.
            We needed to have the same design on tinkercad and in our real life design.
            We did not make major changes to our online design instead we just added new items or finished what we didn't finish.
            This week we also took our quiz on mechanical engineering so we studied a bit then we took our quiz.
            The final thing we did this week was building our machine, we first built the walls and then we added our ramp.

                9/11-9/14 Week 4
                <br>This week was our fourth week in this class.
                We only worked on building on Rube Goldberg Machine.
                Our project needed 3 tools which were a pulley, a car, and a ramp.
                We first taped the pulley rope to the table.
                Then we dropped the baseball into the car which released the tape holding the car.
                Finally the ramp gave the car enough momentum to pop the balloon.

                9/18-9/21 Week 5
                <br>This week we didn't do much, however we did do to challenges.
                Our first challenge was to build a paper boat that could float on the water with weight for 5 minutes.
                My boat lasted the full 5 minutes and it held 59 grams of weight.
                The second challenge that we had to do was create an E and give specific directions for another person to draw it.
                So I drew my E then everyones E's got shuffled and I was handed another person E to follow and cut out. Some issues for the E were not accurate sides
                The final thing we did this week was do a worksheet on Computer Engineering which we are probably going to be starting soon.

                9/25-9/28 Week 6
                <br>This week we learned how to take apart a computer.
                We first had to disasemble each part correctly and then the computer was completely disasemble.
                Then we had to put all the pieces back into the right place.
                If it was not correctly put back together then the computer would not work.
                The final thing we did was take a quiz on computer engineering.

                10/2-10/6 Week 7
                <br> On Monday I was sick so I do not know what our class did on Monday.
                However, I came back to school on Tuesday.
                We worked on making a cardboard prothetic hand that could pick up a plastic watter bottle.
                Our hand used 5 fingers that wrapped around the bottle to pick it up.
                On Thursday we first worked on filling out a worksheet about Biomechanics.
                Then we had to make a tinkercad desgin that was a prosthetic limb for an animal.
                The final thing we did was work on our website.

        10/8-10/12 Week 8
        <br> This week was a 4 day week for freshman due to the psat.
        However we still did quite a bit this week.
        First we switched seats so I am sitting with new people.
        Next we took a quiz on biomechanics, it took a while.
        Then we went over the Aerospace engineering slides and watched a video on space x self landing rocket.
        Finally, we worked on a tinkercad model of our rocket that we are going to make next week.

                10/16-10/19 Week 9
                <br> This week we worked ona bottle rocket. We made our Tinkercad design on Monday to have a good idea of what our rocket was going to be like.
                We only built on Tuesday and we had the whole period to work on it. We used cardboard, a 2 liter bottle,some hot glue, and tape.
                We launched our rocket but it was a big fail. Our rocket got stuck in the launch and didn't go very far
                If I were to change our design I would make it a missle instead of a plane with wings.
                I thought a place with wings would glide to make it farther but the weight distribution made it twist and fall
                A missle design would have made it quicker but not glide but it would have made it farther.

                10/23-10/25 Week 10
                <br>This week we learned about Enviromental Engineering.
                We did a worksheet about Enviromental Engineering and looked on slides.
                We looked at pollution and water treatment.
                The next class we worked project that had to make a filter only using rocks,pebbles,sand, and cotton
                The water that was given was black water and we had to treat it as best as possible.
                My partner and I got our water to a yellow, but it was still clearly contaminated.
                One group got the water to a clear color.

                10/30-11/3 Week 11
                <br> This week we learned about electrical engineering.
                We talked about ohms law which is V(Volts)=I(Amps)*R(resistance).
                We learned about bread boards resistors and LEDs and how to make a ciruit using them.
                There are two types of circuits a parallel and series.
                A parallel the LEDs are not connected and each of them have their own resistor and connect to ground seperatly.
                Series the LEDs are connected and each of them have 1 resistor and 1 ground.

                11/6-11/8 Week 12
                This week we learned worked on real life breadboards.
                We were given a pieces like LED, wires, and resistor.
                Lab 1 was just making a standard circuit with 1 LED on.
                Lab 2 was making a series circuit where LEDS are next to each other and a parallel circuit where the LEDS are parallel to eaach other.
                Lab 3 the same circuits as the previous labs but we had to use a multimeter to find the volatage and the resistance.
                Lab 4 was using an arduino making certain circuits to make the LEDs light up or light off.
